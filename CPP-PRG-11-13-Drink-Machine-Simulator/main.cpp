//  Write a program that simulates a soft drink machine. The program should use a structure
//  that stores the following data:
//
//      Drink Name
//      Drink Cost
//      Number of Drinks in Machine
//
//  The program should create an array of five structures. The elements should be
//  initialized with the following data:
//
//      Drink Name          Cost            Number in Machine
//      -----------------------------------------------------
//      Cola                .75             20
//      Root Beer           .75             20
//      Lemon-Lime          .75             20
//      Grape Soda          .80             20
//      Cream Soda          .80             20
//
//  Each time the program runs, it should enter a loop that performs the following steps:
//  A list of drinks is displayed on the screen. The user should be allowed to either quit the
//  program or pick a drink. If the user selects a drink, he or she will next enter the amount
//  of money that is to be inserted into the drink machine. The program should display the
//  amount of change that would be returned, and subtract one from the number of that
//  drink left in the machine. If the user selects a drink that has sold out, a message should
//  be displayed. The loop then repeats. When the user chooses to quit the program, it
//  should display the total amount of money the machine earned.
//
//  Input Validation: When the user enters an amount of money, do not accept negative
//  values or values greater than $1.00.
